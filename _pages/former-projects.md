## Overview

This page highlights selected past projects completed by our group. Each entry includes a short narrative, key outputs, and links to publications, data, or software when available. We keep this section to document continuity across research lines and to make it easier to reuse methods, datasets, and lessons learned in new initiatives.

## What you will find here

- A short story of each project: the context, what we did, and what changed afterwards
- The main outputs: publications, reports, datasets, software, or decision-support tools
- Where to go next: related current projects, news items, and blog posts
