This website is built from a lightweight, reusable template designed to help our research group publish consistent project pages with minimal setup effort. It is based on the **al-folio** Jekyll theme (open-source), which provides a clean academic layout, built-in support for news items, publications, project pages, and blog posts. ([GitHub][1])

In this template, each project site can keep the same overall structure (navigation, styling, and core sections) while only replacing the project-specific content (summary, highlights, links, people, and outputs). The goal is to make it easy to spin up a new project website, keep it updated over time, and maintain a consistent look across all the group’s projects.

If you are browsing this site as a project page, start with the summary above and then check the rest of the sections:

* **News** for updates, milestones, events, and releases.
* **Selected papers / publications** for peer-reviewed outputs and technical reports.
* **Blog posts** for short notes, tutorials, methods, and behind-the-scenes work.
* **Repositories** for code, workflows, and reproducible materials.
