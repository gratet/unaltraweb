  abstract = {In recent decades, climate change and the global energy transition have prioritised renewable energy adoption. Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems have emerged as a promising solution, aligning with sustainability, decentralisation, and local energy production while efficiently using built spaces. Despite their potential, rooftop PV systems are still unevenly adopted due to technical and economic barriers. A lack of consistent data limits the ability to track adoption and support energy transition planning. This study focuses on Tarragona province (Spain) and assesses the solar PV potential of public and private buildings, including town halls, schools, libraries, and residential properties. Using GIS-based modelling and high-resolution geospatial data, including LiDAR-derived elevation models and cadastral records, we estimate that 38.72\% of rooftops in the province meet suitable technical conditions for PV installation under a conservative scenario. A key contribution is the creation of a geolocated database of 18,577 rooftop PV installations through detailed photointerpretation, enabling spatial assessment of where systems have been deployed and how adoption varies by building type. Statistical analysis reveals contrasts in adoption, with residential buildings showing higher uptake, while public buildings adopted PV later. Results confirm that adoption is shaped by technical potential and sector-specific policy barriers. Findings suggest public buildings could foster broader PV uptake, leveraging peer effects and targeted incentives. This study highlights the need for accurate, publicly accessible PV installation databases to support energy planning, especially in urban and mixed-use areas. By clarifying PV adoption dynamics, this research supports informed policymaking for a more equitable, effective energy transition.},

  abstract     = {Data collected through smart travel cards in public transport networks have become a valuable source of information for transport geography studies. During the last two decades, a growing body of literature has used this sort of data source to study the behaviour of public transport users in cities and regions around the world. However, its use has been scarce in contexts where public transport demand is highly influenced by the activities of the tourist sector. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether these data can be leveraged to optimize the supply of public transport. In this article, data drawn from the Camp de Tarragona automated fare collection system extracted during 2018 are used to study tourists' use of public transport in Costa Daurada (Catalonia, Spain). This is a popular coastal destination with a high concentration of visitors during the summer period. The analysis focuses on the use of the T-10, a multipersonal transport fare with no time limitations on its use which makes it appealing for tourists. Model-based clustering has been applied to identify different clusters of passengers according to their activity and spatial profiles. Differences between profiles are significant and, as a result, this study allowed the validation of a method that could be replicated in other contexts, as it provides highly useful information for public transport policy and mobility management.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
